<h2>My top 3 Netflix shows of all-time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Love Is Blind</h3>
<p>I can't help it, i just love watching trashy reality TV, and love the viewer's comments even more on TikTok. makes me laugh, cry and go through a crazy experience every time.</p>
<h3>Sex And The City</h3>
<p>I have been watching it a lot lately because I am moving to new york city, and I can't help but think, is it the best show about dating that's out there? haha see what i did there, wink wink.</p>
<h3>You</h3>
<p>Love true crime, it is so interesting and creepy to see criminals do their crime. although I really HATE bloody scenes. I can't look.</p>
